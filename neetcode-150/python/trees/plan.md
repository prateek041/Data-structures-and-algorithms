# Technical Interview Preparation Curriculum: Trees

## Introduction to Trees

### Basic Concepts
- Definition of trees, binary trees, and tree terminology (nodes, edges, root, leaves, height, depth, etc.).
- Difference between binary trees and general trees.
- Basic tree traversal methods: In-order, Pre-order, and Post-order traversals.

### Binary Search Trees (BST)
- Properties of BST.
- Insertion, Deletion, and Search operations in BST.
- Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).
- Practice problems:
  - Insert a node in BST.
  - Delete a node in BST.
  - Search for a value in BST.
  - Implement DFS and BFS on binary trees.

### Tree Traversals
- Detailed study of In-order, Pre-order, Post-order, and Level-order traversals.
- Implementation using recursion and iteration.
- Practice problems:
  - Binary Tree Inorder Traversal.
  - Binary Tree Preorder Traversal.
  - Binary Tree Postorder Traversal.
  - Binary Tree Level Order Traversal.

## Advanced Tree Concepts

### Balanced Trees
- Concept of tree balance and the importance of balanced trees.
- Introduction to AVL Trees.
- Rotations in AVL Trees: Left Rotation, Right Rotation, Left-Right Rotation, Right-Left Rotation.

### Red-Black Trees
- Properties of Red-Black Trees.
- Insertion and deletion in Red-Black Trees.

## Specialized Trees and Applications

### Segment Trees and Binary Indexed Trees (Fenwick Tree)
- Introduction to Segment Trees: Construction, Query, and Update operations.
- Introduction to Binary Indexed Trees: Construction, Query, and Update operations.
