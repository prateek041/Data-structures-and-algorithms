# What happens when we pass a variable to a function as an argument.

All the parameters are passed by value in java. But, when we pass an object of non premitive type, then it's refrence is passed as value.

- Primitive types : byte, short, int, long, float, double, char and boolean values are passed as value i.e. changes made to them are not reflected to the main variable.
- Non-primitive types: String, arrays, classes and interfaces are passed by refrence i.e. the changes made to them is reflected on the main variable.
